# Rational Function Generator

I made this program because my peers and I lacked a simple tool for creating polynomial functions for practice.  
It turns out that this year, the Advanced Functions teachers are not giving out math textbooks, as they don’t have enough to supply everyone.

And that's where this highly intuitive program comes into play. Simply:
1. Enter the **highest degree** for the question.  
2. Choose a **difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard) 
3. Pick a **number for the seed** to produce the same problem every time (great for collaboration on problems).

Once you enter those three things, the program generates a **rational function** and prompts you to:
1. Fully factor the function  
2. Find x- and y-intercepts  
3. Describe end behavior  
4. State the domain in interval notation  
5. Determine all asymptotes (vertical and oblique/slant)

The program then allows you to **view the answer key**, as well as **view the graph** which reveal the correct responses.
